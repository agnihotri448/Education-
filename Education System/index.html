                LIndia is divided into 28 states and 7 so-called “Union Territories”. The states have their own elected
                governments while the Union Territories are ruled directly by the Government of India, with the
                President of India appointing an administrator for each Union Territory. As per the constitution of
                India, school education was originally a state subject —that is, the states had complete authority on
                deciding policies and implementing them. The role of the Government of India (GoI) was limited to
                coordination and deciding on the standards of higher education.

                In addition to the above, there are a relatively small number of schools that follow foreign curricula
                such as the so-called Senior Cambridge, though this was largely superseded by the ICSE stream elsewhere.
                Some of these schools also offer the students the opportunity to sit for the ICSE examinations. These
                are usually very expensive residential schools where some of the Indians working abroad send their
                children.

                Each state has three kinds of schools that follow the state curriculum. The government runs its own
                schools in land and buildings owned by the government and paying the staff from its own resources. These
                are generally known as government schools. The fees are quite low in such schools. Then there are
                privately owned schools with their own land and buildings. Here the fees are high and the teachers are
                paid by the management. Such schools mostly cater to the urban middle class families.
